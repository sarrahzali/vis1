# Japanese Exports from 1988 to 2017

# With this visualization we wanted to answer two questions:

# Which countries are the biggest consumers of Japanese goods (Map chart)
# What are the Japanese goods most in demand/ which industrial sector takes the most earrings for exports (Bar chart)
# How have both of these trends shifted after a 27 year span

# (We initially wanted to do 18 years but we felt this year span gave a more interesting picture of Japan as this was a time where global economies shifted from ‘planned’ to more ‘laissez-faire’ ones.

# This visualization, if successful, should display the following key things:

# The advent of the 21st century allowed previously ‘industrializing countries’ such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and Saudia Arabia to become key consumers of high industrial quality goods that Japan is notable for producing. Slowly creeping countries such as Australia are also shown to become much larger consumers.

# Japan’s business with other Asian countries has incredibly augmented, which was part of the Japanese strategy to forge strong relationships with its neighbors to favor stability and control in the region.

# Electronic devices should represent a great part of Japanese exports, as many consumer electronic companies (Sony, Nintendo, etc.) have greatly contributed to Japan’s wealth since at least the 1990s.


# Completed Fall 2020 and made in joint effort with Valentin Porcellini.
